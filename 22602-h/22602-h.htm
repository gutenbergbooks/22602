<h2>AN ILL-USED AUTHOR.</h2>

<p>"I gather, Sir," remarked my fellow-traveller, after I
had put away the writing-block on which I had been
jotting down the outline of an article, "that you are a
literary man, like myself?"</p>

<p>We were the only occupants of a compartment in a
L. &amp; N. W. R. carriage. I had been too absorbed till then
to notice his appearance, but I now observed that he had
rather unkempt hair, luminous eyes, and a soft hat. "Oh,
well," I admitted, "I write."</p>

<p>"But I take it that, whatever you write, it is not <i>poetry</i>,"
he said. What led him to this inference I cannot say, but
I had to confess that it was correct.</p>

<p>"Still, even though you are not a Poet yourself, I hope,"
he said, "you can feel some sympathy for one who has
been so infamously treated as I have."</p>

<p>I replied that I hoped so too.</p>

<p>"Then, Sir," said he, "I will tell you my unhappy story.
At the beginning of this War I was approached by certain
Railway magnates who shall be nameless. It appeared
that they had realised, very rightly, that their official
notices were couched in too cold and formal a style to
reach the heart of their public. So they commissioned me
to supply what I may term the human touch. As a poet,
I naturally felt that this could only be effectively done
through the medium of verse. Well, I rose to the occasion,
Sir; I produced some lines which, printed as they were
written, must infallibly have placed me at the head of all
of my contemporaries. But they were <i>not</i> printed as they
were written. In proof of which I will trouble you to read
very carefully the opening paragraph of those 'Defence of
the Realm Regulations' immediately above your head ...
Only the opening paragraph at present, please!"</p>

<p>I was somewhat surprised, but, thinking it best to
humour him, I read the first sentence, which was: "<i>In
view of possible attack by hostile aircraft, it is necessary
that the blinds of all trains should be kept down after
sunset</i>," and gave him my opinion of it.</p>

<p>"Whether," he said, with some acerbity, "it is or is not
as lucidly expressed as you are pleased to consider, only the
beginning of it is mine. This is what I actually wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'In view of possible attack</p>
<p>By hostile aircraft overhead,</p>
<p>'Tis necessary now, alack!</p>
<p>Soon as old Sol has sought his bed,</p>
<p>That those who next the window sit,</p>
<p>Though they'd prefer to watch the gloaming,</p>
<p>Should draw the blind, nor leave a slit,</p>
<p>Keeping it down until they're homing,</p>
<p>Else on the metals will be thrown</p>
<p>A glowing trail as from a comet,</p>
<p>And Huns to whom a train is shown</p>
<p>Will most indubitably bomb it!'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"That," he observed complacently, "is not only verse of
the highest order, but clearly conveys the reason for such
precautions, which the official mind chose to cut out. And
now let me ask you to read the next paragraph." I did so.
"<i>At night-time when the blinds are drawn</i>" it ran, "<i>passengers
are requested before alighting to make sure when the
train stops that it is at the platform</i>."</p>

<p>"Which," he cried fiercely, "is their mangled and mutilated
version of this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'At night-time when the blinds are drawn</p>
<p>(As screens against those devils' spawn,</p>
<p>Which love the gloom, but dread the dawn),</p>
<p>A train may be at standstill,</p>
<p>Then we request 'twill not occur</p>
<p>That some impatient passenger,</p>
<p>Whose nerves are in a chronic stir,</p>
<p>And neither feet nor hands still,</p>
<p>Without preliminary peep</p>
<p>Will forth incontinently leap,</p>
<p>Alighting in a huddled heap</p>
<p>To lie, a limp or flat form,</p>
<p>In some inhospitable ditch,</p>
<p>If not on grittier ballast, which</p>
<p>(The darkness far surpassing pitch)</p>
<p>He took to be the platform!'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"As to the next paragraph," he continued, "I don't
complain so much, though, personally, I consider '<i>Extract
from Order made by the Secretary of State for the Home
Department</i>' a very poor paraphrase of the resounding
couplet in which I introduced him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Now speaks in genial tones, from heart to heart meant,</p>
<p>The Secretary for the Home Department!'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"I could have overlooked that, Sir, if they had retained
the lines I had written for him. But they've only let him
speak the first four words&mdash;'<i>Passengers in Railway Carriages</i>'&mdash;and
then drivel on thus: '<i>which are provided with
blinds must keep the blinds covered so as to cover the
windows'</i>&mdash;a clumsy tautology, Sir, for which I am sure no
Home Secretary would care to be held responsible, and
from which I had been at some pains to save him, as you
may judge when I read you the original text:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'Passengers in railway carriages</p>
<p>Possess a sense which none disparages;</p>
<p>So those who are not perverse or froward</p>
<p>May be trusted to see that the blinds are lowered,</p>
<p>To cover the windows so totally</p>
<p>That no one inside can be seen, or see.</p>
<p>Mem.&mdash;This need not be done, as lately decided,</p>
<p>If blinds for the windows have not been provided.'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"But," he went on, "the deadliest injury those infernal
officials reserved for the last. If you read the concluding
sentence, Sir, you will observe that it begins: '<i>The blinds
may be lifted in case of necessity</i>!' (That, I need hardly
say, is <i>entirely</i> my own. There is a sort of inspired swing
in it, the true lyrical lilt with which even red-tape has not
dared to tamper! But mark how they go on): '<i>when the
train is at a standstill at a station, but, if lifted, they must
be lowered again before the train starts</i>.' And this insufferable
bathos, forsooth, was substituted for lines like these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"'The blinds may be lifted in case of necessity;</p>
<p>Thus, if the train at a station should halt,</p>
<p>And the traveller hears not its name, nor can guess it, he</p>
<p>Cannot be held to commit any fault,</p>
<p>Still farther be fined,</p>
<p>Should he pull up the blind</p>
<p>Out of mere curiosity: had he not looked</p>
<p>He might miss the station for which he had booked!'</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"Well," he concluded, "that is my case. But I can
never put it before the public myself. My pride would not
permit me. Though, if someone&mdash;yourself, for instance&mdash;would
present my claims to redress&mdash;"</p>

<p>I couldn't help thinking that he had been hardly treated,
and so I undertook to do what I could for him. He gave
me his verses, also his name, which latter I have unfortunately
forgotten. However, I hope I have redeemed my
promise here in other respects.</p>

<p>There are times when I wonder uneasily whether he may
not have been pulling my leg. But, after all, he could have
had no possible object in doing that. Besides, if, the next
time you travel by the L. &amp; N.-W., you will study the
printed instructions in your compartment, I fancy you will
agree with me that they corroborate his statements to a
rather remarkable extent.</p>

<h2>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.</h2>

<p>It has come as an immense relief to
all true lovers of peace to learn that
such German soldiers as have been
taking part in the war on the Italian
frontier have previously resigned their
positions in the <span class="sc">Kaiser's</span> army and
been re-enrolled under the Austrian
flag, so that no untoward incident
may disturb the profound peace which
exists between Germany and Italy.
All the same there are elements of
possible danger in the situation which
should be carefully watched. We look
forward to a time when our gallant
ally may be confidently expected to
advance on to German soil, and we
think it would be well for the authorities
at Rome (unless the invading host
is provided with Montenegrin uniforms)
to serve out beforehand a large number
of tourist coupons, available over a
wide choice of different routes. This
might avert the terrible consequences
that are likely to follow a breach of
relations.</p>

<p>Of course it must be remembered
that Italy has now signed on not to
enter into a separate peace, and no
doubt the only true economy is to
make the present one go as far as
possible, as it cannot be replaced.
Still, since the sinking of the <i>Ancona</i>
by a German crew (partially whitewashed
so as to look like Austrians),
Italy's neutrality has become of an
extremely virulent order.</p>

<p>We need hardly say that President
<span class="sc">Wilson</span> even on his honeymoon is
closely watching the situation and
thinking over it very deeply, very
slowly and very calmly, hoping to discover
hints for his own future guidance.
It is said that he feels himself being
drawn more and more into the vortex,
and his attitude of passive belligerency
may be followed by one of aggressive
non-interference. It is common knowledge
in Washington that if he can get
no satisfaction on the <i>Ancona</i> question
he will either despatch a new note
(which will be <i>almost</i> an ultimatum)
or simply pass on and declare war on
Albania.</p>

<p>Portugal (as the ancient ally of
Great Britain), who has already been
involved in a scrap with German troops
in Angola, is naturally deeply exercised
as to what are her present relations
with Turkey. The matter is an urgent
one and might become crucial in the
event of a Turkish Zeppelin drifting in
a fog over Portuguese territory.</p>

<p>The King of <span class="sc">Greece</span> is said to have
found a happy solution of his difficulty
about a Bulgarian invasion of Greece.
The incoming forces are to be provided
with return tickets to Salonika and
back, available only for forty-five days,
and containing a stipulation that the
traveller may not break his journey at
any other point.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Relations between Potsdam and Sofia
are said to be badly strained.
Three days after the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> had
issued his celebrated manifesto,
"To my noble and heroic Serbian
people," <span class="sc">Ferdinand</span> in the Sobranje
was publicly denouncing
the Serbians as obstinate, treacherous,
and tyrannical. The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>
considers this conduct extremely
tactless, and threatens, if it continues,
to spell Bulgarian with a
"V."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>All hitherto-published explanations
of the threatened German
attack on the Suez Canal are
hereby cancelled. The fact is that

rapidly that it has outgrown its

laundry at the Grand Hotel,
Room 408, Tuesday evening after

the original plan to have the

why the members of the expedition
have since washed their dirty

<h2>THE VINDICATION OF JIMMY.</h2>

<p>In one corner of the school play-ground
stood a small boy in deep
dejection, with his hands in his pockets,
his lower lip trembling slightly, whilst
he strove to kick a hole in the ground
with his right toe. It was Jimmy&mdash;Jimmy
in his hour of trial.</p>

<p>He wasn't going to blub, he wasn't
going to do anything.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped kicking at the
ground, as he remembered that his
mother had told him he must be
careful of his boots now that the War
was on.</p>

<p>He took out of his pocket a match-box,
the temporary home of a large
beetle&mdash;a buzzer, Jimmy called it&mdash;which
had hitherto refused to eat
either grass or bran or Indian corn.
His gaze then wandered to a hole in
his stockings, which he had mended
by applying ink to the exposed part
of his skin.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the playground
came the tumultuous noise of
the calm deliberations of Form II.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew perfectly well that
they were discussing him, and that in
time one of their number would be
sent to inform him of the verdict and
sentence.</p>

<p>He expected that he would have to
fight them all, one by one, and he
wondered how many blows he would
be able to stand without returning
them, for to hit back was out of the
question under the unfortunate circumstances.</p>

<p>Jimmy wished they would get it
over, for he was quite willing to undergo
any form of punishment they might
decide upon, if only they would let him
know quickly. He hoped they wouldn't
make the Biffer fight him, not that
he was afraid of the Biffer, but because
it would be so hard to keep himself
from hitting back, and that he had
decided not to do. You see the Biffer
was a new boy, and, for another thing,
he wore a leather strap round his
wrist. On his very first day at school
the Biffer had volunteered the information
that he once gave a boy such a
biff on the nose that he had sprained
his wrist, and that ever since he had
worn a wrist strap, lest it should happen
again. It was Jimmy who had nick-named
him the Biffer, and from that
time the Biffer had sought Jimmy's
blood.</p>

<p>But Jimmy was not easy to quarrel
with.</p>

<p>He was the acknowledged champion
of Form II., and you had to commit
three offences before Jimmy would
seriously consider you. At the first
offence you got a note with the one
word "Beware!" written upon it; at
the second, another note with the word
"Blood" written underneath a skull
and crossbones; and at the third you
received a note with the word "Deth,"
and underneath was the drawing of a
coffin.</p>

<p>The Biffer had so far arrived at the
second note.</p>

<p>Jimmy did hope they wouldn't choose
the Biffer, for he could hear even now
the Biffer's yell when he had made that
awful mistake which had brought
about the present deplorable situation.</p>

<p>Jimmy couldn't think how he had
come to say what he did say; he could
have bitten off his tongue when he
realised it; but it was too late&mdash;he had
said it.</p>

<p>He tried to think how it had all
occurred, and the scene flashed again
before his mind. There was the master
with his pointer resting upon the
Dogger Bank on the map of Europe.</p>

<p>"Who can tell me the name of this
sea?" he had said, and Jimmy had
snapped his fingers and waved his
arm about in his anxiety to catch the
master's eye. You see, it was so
seldom, so very seldom, that Jimmy
felt he knew the right answer to any
question, and the new experience was
intoxicating. The master too seemed
to find it unusual, and he at once
turned to Jimmy and said, "Well, what
is this sea called, then?" Jimmy, full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
of the pride of knowledge, burst out
with "The North Sea, Sir." Oh! if he
had only stopped at that; but in his
desire to show how much he knew he
added without thinking the fatal words,
"or German Ocean!"</p>

<p>In the shout of derision which had
followed, Jimmy realised what he had
said, and felt himself falling, falling,
falling....</p>

<p>Jimmy became aware that the noise
on the opposite side of the playground
was ceasing, and soon, from the corner
of his eye, he saw Jones minimus detach
himself from the crowd. "Half a
mo'," he heard Jones minimus say;
"I want to get a knotted handkerchief,"
and he saw him hurry into the school.
As he emerged he flourished the knotted
handkerchief, but when delivering the
verdict to Jimmy that he would have
to run the gauntlet three times to the
tune of the knotted handkerchiefs of
Form II., he tried to smuggle into
Jimmy's hands an exercise-book which
he said Jimmy could stuff up his back;
it would stick there if Jimmy buttoned
his jacket, he said, and it would take
the sting off a bit. Jimmy had to bite
his lip as he refused the exercise-book,
and then with head erect and lips no
longer trembling he went forth to face
the ordeal.</p>

<p>Form II. had arranged themselves
in two ranks, facing one another, and
the knots in the handkerchiefs were
firm and hard. "You have got to
bunk through and back again and
then down again," said Jones minimus
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>The Biffer was at the head of one
rank, and had got his handkerchief
slung over his shoulder in happy readiness
for the first blow.</p>

<p>"Are you ready? Go!" shouted
Form II. in one voice.</p>

<p>At the word "Go!" Jimmy pulled
his hands out of his pockets&mdash;he was
glad his mother wasn't there to see
him&mdash;and with head still up and eyes
to the front he walked slowly up the
double lines and as slowly down them.
The Biffer got in a good one, he got in
two before Jimmy was out of reach,
and he then changed the handkerchief
to his left hand in readiness for the
return journey. Arrived at the end of
the lines, Jimmy turned on his heel
and began to walk even more slowly
than at first.</p>

<p>But there was no sting in the blows
this time; all the zest seemed to have
gone out of the affair; and, but for the
whack the Biffer gave, Jimmy never
felt anything. The third time down
was a farce, for, after Jimmy had deliberately
stopped opposite the Biffer in
order to let him have as many as his
injured soul required, no one touched
him. In fact they were all shaking
hands with Jimmy, who was now his
smiling self once more and ready to
play with the best of them, when suddenly
the Biffer took it into his head
to make a joke.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he <i>is</i> a German," said the
Biffer, and waited for the general
laugh to follow his sally.</p>

<p>But the laugh didn't come; instead
there was a dead silence.</p>

<p>Who was the Biffer&mdash;a new boy at
that&mdash;to call anyone a German? Instinctively
a ring was formed and the
Biffer found himself in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Jimmy took off his coat and gave it
to Jones minimus, who danced for sheer
delight.</p>

<p>Jimmy had only one regret: the
butcher-boy was not there to see him&mdash;the
butcher-boy who had expended so
much time over him, had taught him
the upper cut, the under cut, every cut
that the heart of a butcher-boy delights
in. The Biffer was very busy biffing the
air with a rapid circular motion of the
arms, for Jimmy's fixed scowl and set
of jaw troubled him.</p>

<p>Oh, why wasn't the butcher-boy there
to see that tremendous smack on the
nose the Biffer got? He would have
felt amply rewarded.</p>

<p>No one had ever seen Jimmy fight
like this, and Jones minimus shouted
in his joy, for the Biffer was outbiffed
in every direction.</p>

<p>In vain did he cry "<i>Pax</i>," for Jimmy
had not half relieved his feelings, and
there was no end to the dodges the
butcher-boy had taught him, each of
which, he had said, meant sudden death.</p>

<p>"He's had enough, Jimmy," whispered
Jones minimus. "I'm satisfied,"
he added as the Biffer, who was lying
on the ground, refused to get up and
have any more.</p>

<p>As the boys entered the class-room
the next day there was the map of
Europe still hanging up in front of the
class, and the very first question that
was asked by the master was, "Well,
Jimmy, what is this sea?"</p>

<p>"The North Sea or British Ocean,
Sir!" said Jimmy, a reply that was
greeted with a rousing cheer by the
whole of Form II.</p>

<h2>A TURKISH TROPHY.</h2>

<p>(<i>A belated letter from Gallipoli.</i>)</p>

<p>My dear &mdash;&mdash;, By this week's post
I trust you will receive the long promised
trophy, to wit one Turkish
headpiece procured by my own personal
exertions. As the story of its
capture, though somewhat out of the
ordinary, has been passed over in stony
silence both by the official <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i>
and "Our Special Correspondent" I shall
endeavour to give you a brief impression
of the difficulties overcome as truthfully
as my sense of imagination will
allow me. First of all I must draw a
map:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/008.png"><img width="100%" src="images/008.png" alt="" /></a>
  <p>A B British trench, with traverses.</p>
  <p>C D Turkish trench, without.</p>
  <p>E F Ditch</p>
  <p>G British barricade.</p>
  <p>H Turkish barricade.</p></div>

<p>This should give you an idea of the
English and Turkish lines at a point
where they are about eighty yards
apart. Without going into details you
will see the English trench is of the
superior pattern, as it has traverses.
I had to work in that technical term to
show I know all about it; I know
another, "the berm," but I am not too
sure about what that is, and also I
don't suppose I could draw a "berm" if
I saw one. Anyway, I know it's quite
a good term connected with trenches,
as I heard a G.O.C. fairly strafe a
subaltern, the other day, because he
hadn't got a "berm." Well, to refer
to the map, you will observe that there
is an old ditch running between the
two lines of trenches, and both sides
have advanced a certain distance along
this ditch and have built barricades
about ten yards apart. Every day it
is part of my job to take a constitutional
along our trenches, and after
discussing the European situation and
the latest Budget with the various
battalion commanders to ask them
whether there is any particularly obnoxious
part of the opposition line they
would like me to salute with my battery.
Usually they say, "No, there's
nothing in particular, but let's have a
shoot all the same; for example, there's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
a dog that barks abominably every
night opposite L 57. Couldn't you
abolish him?" Incidentally we no
longer give our trenches names, such
as Piccadilly, Rotten Row, but mere
letters and numbers; the reason being
that one of the staff was picked up in
a fainting condition, having strolled
down Park Lane and then found himself,
to his horror, in Peckham High
Street. The shock&mdash;his own home
being in Baling Broadway&mdash;had proved
too much for his constitution. However,
to refer back to the map once
more, our barricade across the ditch
is a most convenient spot for observing
artillery fire and as such is frequently
used by me. Unfortunately my view
was always hasty and badly interrupted
by the attentions of a Turkish sniper
behind their barricade. This man's
name was Ibrahim, and he was a
Constantinople cab-driver, married,
with two children, both boys. You
may be surprised that we know so
much about the enemy, but we live in
such close proximity that opposite the
Lancashire Fusiliers a Turk named
Mahomet, who lives at No. 3, Golden
Horn Terrace, told the reporter of <i>The
Worpington Headlight</i> that for three
years he had been suffering from pains
in the back&mdash;but that's another story.
Incidentally Mahomet at present inhabits
a sniper's post surrounded by a
perfect thicket of barbed-wire, and I
had a bright scheme for its removal. I
got hold of a trench catapult, an ingenious
contrivance of elastic that
hurls a bomb some hundreds of yards,
and placed in it a harpoon attached to
a long coil of rope. The idea was that
on release of the catapult the harpoon
would be hurled in the air, the rope
would neatly pay out, and then, as soon
as the harpoon had grappled Mahomet,
all we would have to do would be to
haul on the rope and over would come
the whole bag of tricks. Unfortunately
something went wrong, and the rope,
instead of neatly uncoiling, flailed round
the trench like a young anaconda, and,
catching a harmless spectator by the
leg, hurled him twenty feet in the air.
Immediately the opposition lines resounded
like a rifle-booth at a country
fair. However our spectator descended
unpunctured, and the only damage done
was to our vanity, when Mahomet
threw over a message attached to a
stone to ask whether we would repeat
the performance as he and a pal had
a bet on as to who was the best
shot and wanted a human aeroplane
to judge.</p>

<p>But we have got a long way from
Ibrahim. Ibrahim possessed the headpiece
I am sending you. I could not
think of a method for obtaining it, as
his vigilance was deadly. However a
bright thought struck me, and I assiduously
saved up my rum ration for a
month. Then one bitter cold night I
tossed over the accumulation in a bottle
wrapped up in an old sock. Presently
there resounded in the still air a
pleasant bubbling sound indicative of
liquid being poured out of a glass
receptacle, then a deep sigh, followed
by a profound silence. Inch by inch I
crawled over our barricade and slowly
wormed my way along the ditch. At
last I reached the Turkish barricade
and cautiously slid my hand over the
top until my fingers encountered
Ibrahim's toque. Then I gave a gentle
tug. Horror! he had the flap down
under his chin. Unmanned for a
moment I recovered, and I slowly slid
my fingers down his hirsute neck and
with a gentle titillation slid the flap
clear. Ibrahim merely stirred in his
sleep and resumed his slumbers.
Triumphantly hugging the trophy to
my bosom I crawled back to our
barricade.</p>

<p>The saddest part of the tale is yet to
come. I had promised to procure you
a trophy unstained by association with
human slaughter, but when the day
dawned there lay poor Ibrahim stiff
and stark behind his barricade, killed
by a cold in his head.</p>

<h3>A Debt of Honour.</h3>

<p>Mr. Punch ventures to plead on behalf
of the nine hundred men of the
Royal Naval Division who were taken
prisoners by the enemy in the retirement
from Antwerp. Less fortunate
than those of the same Division who
were interned in Holland (for want of
official information most people imagine
that all the missing were so interned),
they lack the necessities of life. Parcels
of food are sent to them, fortnightly
to each man, as well as clothing and
tobacco; and it is known that they
receive all that is sent. Mr. Punch

<h2>STUDIES IN FRUSTRATION.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The scene was the comfortable spacious
breakfast-room in the Bishop's
Palace. His lordship sat nearest to
the fire; the bishop's wife presided
over the fragrant coffee-pot, and the
curate, their dine-and-sleep guest, sat
opposite the bishop and farthest from
the warmth. As a curate this position
was his due. Some day he also would
be a bishop, and then he too would
know what it was to intercept the
glow.</p>

<p>The curate was looking dubiously
into the recesses of an egg. His fine
Anglican features underwent a series
of contortions.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said the bishop, "that
that egg is not a good one."</p>

<p>"You are right, my lord," said the
curate. " It is not only bad, it's alive.
I think it's the worst egg that was
ever offered me."</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The wounded soldier lay in his deck-chair
placidly smoking his hundredth
cigarette that day. He was not naturally
a smoker, but cigarettes arrived in
enormous numbers and something had
to be done with them.</p>

<p>His visitor sat beside him, note-book
in hand. "Yes?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"And then," said the soldier, "came
the order to charge. We fixed bayonets
and rushed at the Bosches like mad.
It was glorious&mdash;like the best kind of
football match."</p>

<p>The visitor took it all down, and
more.</p>

<p>"I remember bayonetting two men,"
said the soldier, "and then I remember
nothing else. And that's six months
ago. Still, I'm getting well, and then
there's only one thing on earth that
I really want with a passionate desire ..."</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" said the visitor,
moistening his pencil.</p>

<p>"Never to see any more war as long
as I live," the soldier continued.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The aged artist sat in his luxurious
studio surrounded by his masterpieces&mdash;that
is, by the pictures he had never
been able to sell.</p>

<p>The gem of the collection stood on
an easel in the middle of the room;
while a connoisseur, hat in hand, inspected
it closely, enthusiastically,
breathlessly. Then, coming over to
where the artist was resting, he sat
down opposite to him and in a voice
trembling with emotion asked, "Tell
me, how <i>do</i> you mix your colours?"</p>

<p>There was a deep silence, almost
painful in its intensity. A drawing-pin
fell with a deafening crash.</p>

<p>The venerable painter stood up with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
a calm and leonine expression. "I use
an ivory palette knife," he said.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The shadows were lengthening in
the beautiful garden. It was a warm
spring evening. The old sun-dial had
just struck seven.</p>

<p>The poet threw aside his book and
called his Airedale terrier; the dog, responding
in time, eventually reached
his master's knee.</p>

<p>Seizing his opportunity, the representative
of the Press observed, "You
are, I see, fond of dogs."</p>

<p>"Fond of dogs?" replied the poet.
"I? I detest them;" and so saying he
kicked the Airedale a distance of several
feet into the air, so that, falling immediately
on the sun-dial, it was transfixed
by the gnomon.</p>

<p>As he watched its struggles, thus
impaled, the poet laughed the hearty
resonant laugh for which he was
famous.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The Civil Service clerk so famous for
his drollery was entering the office
doors at half-past ten in the morning,
or exactly sixty minutes past the
appointed time. By an unfortunate
chance his principal met him, as, alas!
he had too often done, at the same tardy
hour. "Late again," said the great
man, consulting his watch. "I believe
that you get here later every day."
"Yes," said the clerk, "I do. But then
I always stay on and work overtime."</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The eminent publicist replaced his
glass on the table and turned to the
lady who sat beside him. "My business,"
he said, "is the manufacture of
mustard. I have made a vast fortune
out of it."</p>

<p>"How very interesting," the lady
replied absently; but the next moment,
inspired by a hidden thought, she added
with quickened interest, "Please don't
think me inquisitive, but how can a
fortune be made out of a thing like
mustard? People take so little of it."</p>

<p>"Madam," answered the mustard
magnate deliberately, "we do not
make our fortunes from the mustard
that people eat"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes?" cried the lady eagerly.&mdash;"but,"
he continued, "from what
they spill in mixing poultices."</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The famous money-lender one evening
arrived as usual at the Casino,
but this time only to bid his friends
good-bye.</p>

<p>"Not leaving Monte?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," he replied; "I'm going
to Rome."</p>

<p>"Rome?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why not? I'm told it's wonderful.
I shall be there a month;"
and so saying he hurried to his hotel.</p>

<p>Three days later he walked into the
Casino again.</p>

<p>"What," cried his friends&mdash;"you
here? We thought you were going to
be in Rome a month."</p>

<p>"So I am," said the money-lender,
"and more. I came back for my things,
most of which I left here, as it had
occurred to me I might not like it.
But I adore it. Rome is beautiful,
august, sublime. The simple severe
beauty of the Vatican, the vast solemnity
of the Campagna! It is indeed the
eternal city. Let me keep Rome!"</p>

<p>And again he hurried away.</p>

<p><i>December</i> 15.</p>

<p>Dear Miss Dalgleish,&mdash;I send you
as promised, when we parted in Skye,
one of my little drawings. I am sorry
I have had no time to get it framed. I
am off in ten days to India to resume
my work. If you have no room for
this little picture on your walls it will
do for a Red Cross Bazaar.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Simpson,&mdash;So many
thanks for the drawing of the bay. It
will always remind me of our delightful

me feel again in the fresh air of Scotland.</p>

<p>Dearest Mary,&mdash;I am sending you
a little Christmas card, in the shape
of a water-colour drawing with a
calendar attached, which can be removed
each year. It will remind you
of the fine time we spent bathing and
boating on the Welsh Coast, which I
know you people in the North adore.
I have long wanted to send you some
token of our days together in that
pleasant land, and, after much searching,
here at last it is.</p>

that glorious Welsh Coast, that heaving
sea and those sunny cliffs, when I am
barely existing in this gloomy city!
<i>Always</i> will this <i>dear</i> scene be in my
sight morning and evening, to remind
me of my friend whom I miss <i>so much</i>,

I cannot let the New Year pass without
sending you a little picture of our

my <i>immense</i> admiration for your charming

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p>"<span class="sc">Puss in Boots.</span>"</p>

<p>If Messrs. <span class="sc">Sims, Dix</span> and <span class="sc">Collins</span>
did in fact, as they claim, make the
book of this year's pantomime at the
Lane, Mr. <span class="sc">George Graves</span> gagged and
bound it. This popular annual festival
indeed tends to become more and more
of a <span class="sc">Graves</span> solo (with of course the
innumerable customary <i>da capos</i>) and
a bright sketchy <span class="sc">Evans</span> <i>obbligato</i>. As
a Grand Duchess and Duke respectively
the genial twain present themselves.
Mr. <span class="sc">George Graves</span>, in a flounced skirt
of green tartan check, copper curls
and mahogany features, is a delectable
creation; says some strangely unlady-like
things (as is expected of him);
is still oddly preoccupied with "gear-boxes"
and other anatomical detail; and
generally indulges in a fine careless
rapture of reminiscence and improvisation&mdash;zealously
assisted by Mr. <span class="sc">Will
Evans</span>' familiar tip-tilted nose and
bland refusal to be perturbed by entirely
unrehearsed effects and obviously
irregular cues. A jovial and irreverent
pair of potentates, crowned by public
laughter.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a sort of background
to all this audacious fooling,
more definitely directed <i>virginibus
puerisque</i>. The new principal boy,
Mr. <span class="sc">Eric Marshall</span>, woos his princess
with a romantic air and a mellow
tenor, in which emotion somewhat
overshadows tone. Miss <span class="sc">Florence
Smithson</span>, an accepted Drury Lane
favourite, looks very charming, makes
love in pretty kitten wise and still
indulges in those queer harmonics of
hers&mdash;virtuosity rather than artistry,
shall we call it?&mdash;but is altogether quite
a nice princess of pantomime. Little
<span class="sc">Ren&eacute;e Mayer</span> is the Puss. Nothing
could well be daintier. But I hope
she will let me tell her (in a whisper,
so that the others won't hear), that she
doesn't <i>quite</i> realise what a jolly part
she has got. I would implore her to
spend an hour or two at serious play
with any decent young cat and study
the grace and variety of its beautiful,
imitable gestures. Then she will assuredly
pounce on her magician turned
mouse, and fawn on her master and
friends, with a greater air of conviction.
And she will mightily please all the
other nice children in the house.</p>

<p>Of the great <i>ensemble</i> scenes unquestionably
the finest was the Fairy
Garden, with a quite beautiful back-cloth
by <span class="sc">R. McCleery</span> and a bewildering
(and, to tell truth, largely bewildered)
bevy of butterflies, decked by <span class="sc">Comelli,</span>
fluttering in a flowery pleasaunce. And
there was also a clever variation on
the now inevitable staircase <i>motif</i> as
a <i>finale</i>. But the Harlequinade of
happy memory has deplorably declined
to something like a mere display of
advertisements&mdash;a sad business.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="sc">The Starlight Express.</span>"</p>

<p>It would be uncandid to pretend
that Mr. <span class="sc">Algernon Blackwood</span> gets
everything he has to say in <i>The
Starlight Express</i> safely across the
footlights&mdash;those fateful barriers that
trap so many excellent intentions. But
he so evidently <i>has</i> something to say,
and the saying is so gallantly attempted,
that he must emphatically be credited
with something done&mdash;something
rather well done really. The little
play has beautiful moments&mdash;and that
is to say a great deal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/016.png"><img width="100%" src="images/016.png" alt=""/></a><p><i>Princess Rosabel</i> ... Miss <span class="sc">Florence
Smithson</span></p>
<p><i>Florian</i> ... Mr. <span class="sc">Eric Marshall</span>.</p>
<p><i>Princess Rosabel</i> and <i>Florian</i>, a young man&mdash;though only a
miller's son&mdash;of considerable polish, especially about the hair and
feet.</p></div>

<p>This novelist turned playwright
wishes to make you see that "the
Earth's forgotten it's a Star." In
plainer words he wants to present you
with a cure for "wumbledness." People
who look at the black side of things,
who think chiefly of themselves&mdash;these
are the wumbled. The cure is star-dust&mdash;which
is sympathy. The treatment
was discovered by the children
of a poor author in a cheap Swiss <i>pension</i>
and by "Cousinenry," a successful
business man of a quite unusual sort.
You have to get out into the cave
where the starlight is stored, gather it&mdash;with
the help of the Organ Grinder,
who loves all children and sings his
cheery way to the stars; and the
Gardener, who makes good things grow
and plucks up all weeds; and the
Lamplighter, who lights up heads and
hearts and stars impartially; and the
Sweep, who sweeps away all blacks
and blues over the edge of the world,
and the Dustman, with his sack of
Dream-dust that is Star-dust (or isn't
it?), and so forth. Then you sprinkle
the precious stuff on people, and they
become miracles of content and unselfishness.
(The fact that life isn't in
the very least like that is a thing you
have just got to make yourself forget
for three hours or so.)</p>

<p>The author was well served by his
associates. Sir <span class="sc">Edward Elgar</span> wove
a delightfully patterned music of
mysterious import through the queer
tangle of the scenes and gave us
an atmosphere loaded with the finest
star-dust. Lighting and setting
were admirably contrived; and the
grouping of the little prologue scenes,
where that kindly handsome giant of
an organ-grinder (Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Mott</span>),
with the superbly cut corduroys, sang
so tunefully to as sweet a flock of little
maids as one could wish to see, was
particularly effective.</p>

<p>Of the players I would especially
commend the delicately sensitive performance
of Miss <span class="sc">Mercia Cameron</span> (a
name and talent quite new to me) as
<i>Jane Anne</i>, the chief opponent of wumbledom.
She was, I think, responsible
more than any other for getting some
of the mystery of the authentic Black-woodcraft
across to the audience. The
jolly spontaneity of <span class="sc">Ronald Hammond</span>
as young <i>Bimbo</i> was a pleasant thing,
and <span class="sc">Elise Hall</span>, concealing less successfully
her careful training in the
part, prettily co-operated as his sister
<i>Monkey</i>. The part of <i>Daddy</i>, the congested
author who was either "going
to light the world or burst," was in
<span class="sc">O. B. Clarence's</span> clever sympathetic
hands. Mr. <span class="sc">Owen Roughwood</span> gave
you a sense of his belief in the efficacy
of star-dust. On what a difficult rail
our author was occasionally driving
his express you may judge when he
makes this excellent but not particularly
fragile British type exclaim,
"I am melting down in dew." The
flippant hearer had always to be inhibiting
irreverent speculations occasioned
by such speeches.</p>

<p>I couldn't guess if the children in
the audience liked it. I hope they
didn't feel they had been spoofed, as
<span class="sc">Maeterlinck</span> so basely spoofed them
in <i>The Blue Bird</i>, by offering them a
grown-ups' play "sicklied o'er with the
pale cast of thought." But the bigger
children gave the piece a good welcome,
and called and acclaimed the shrinking
author. T.</p>

<h2>THEY.</h2>

<p>Just lately I have been thinking
often of Them. But Their image has
never been more vividly in my mind
than now, when I sit here among the
aftermath of festival. I wonder, for
example, are the homes in which They
live pervaded with this same <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of
Christmas (or, as They themselves are
so fond of calling it, Yuletide)? Does
dismembered turkey coldly furnish forth
Their meals? Are there too many
calendars, and a litter of crumpled
paper? And cards&mdash;do They send each
other cards? Stupendous thought!</p>

<p>Most of all is my fancy busy with
Them to-morrow, Tuesday, December
the twenty-eighth. I see Them rising,
a little wearily, perhaps, and heavy-eyed.
Breakfast They snatch, and so
out into the winter morning towards
that place where, unknown and unrecognised,
They pursue throughout the
year Their changeless toil. I imagine
Them gathering with mutual greetings
in the workroom&mdash;a little company
about whose features I have so often
speculated. Poets are there, and artists;
probably some among the men may
wear their hair a trifle longer than the
military fashion of to-day; but the
greater part of the crowd are almost
certainly women. Now the talk dies
down; presently They are all once
more bending in silence over Their
appointed tasks.</p>

<p>Yes, here at one desk is the artist to
whose genius we owe the obese robin
perched upon a horse-shoe, or the
churchyard by moonlight after (apparently)
a severe spangle-storm. Here
again a poet, whose eye in a fine frenzy
rolling proclaims an inspiration, or at
least some subtle variant upon a
familiar theme. He stoops and, even
as I watch, has traced swiftly, with
vibrant pen, this couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"The old, old wish I send to thee,</p>
<p>Jocund may thy Xmas be!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then, with a little sigh, he leans
back, satisfied that for him the holiday
intermission had not rusted the
fine edge of originality. "Jocund"
proved that.</p>

<p>Behind him perhaps sits a maiden
like Fate, who with abhorred shears
fashions strange shapes and borderings
of foliage unknown to mere nature.
And further still, in yonder obscure
and shadowy corner, is one who by
her art can penetrate the future and
outstrip the foot of Time himself. For
see, upon her cards, there is already
written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"With every blessing good and true</p>
<p>May the New Year be packed,</p>
<p>And 1917 bring to you</p>
<p>What 1916 lacked."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I wonder&mdash;how does their work seem
to Them upon this morning after
Boxing-day?</p>

<p>"If," I said, "it depended on me I wouldn't. I'd take
you at your word and have you out of the room in two-twos.
But you wouldn't like that, now, would you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I should have to enter a protest. That's
right, isn't it? Protests <i>are</i> things that have to be entered,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "they're like candidates for examinations,
or rooms, only some rooms oughtn't to be entered,
but are."</p>

<p>"Jocose?" said Francesca.</p>

<p>"No," I said; "I was thinking of Blue Beard. I daresay
you remember about him. He was a very uxorious
man, you know, and most domestic. Something of a
traveller, and when"&mdash;</p>

<p>"We won't worry about Blue Beard," she said. "I
think I know the outlines of his family history."</p>

<p>"Well then," I said, "why can't you leave me alone?
You see I'm busy and yet you insist on staying here and
interrupting me. Do you call that being a helpmeet?"</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I call it joining myself unto you, and
that's what we were told to do to one another in the
marriage service."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," I said. "I was told to do that unto
you, but you were told to submit yourself unto me and to
reverence me."</p>

<p>"It's all the same," she said. "All I'm doing is to help
you to obey the Prayer-Book."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," I said, "you've sat down and you mean to
stay here. Is that what it comes to?"</p>

<p>"It is," she said. "You're in tremendous guessing form
to-day."</p>

<p>"All I know," I said gloomily, "is that if my return for
Income Tax contains many mistakes it'll be your fault, not
mine; and I shall take care so to inform the <span class="sc">Chancellor
of the Exchequer</span>. I shall put down in the Exemptions
and Abatements, 'Interrupted by wife. Abatement claimed,
&pound;100.' The <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> will understand. He's a married
man himself."</p>

<p>"So you're doing your Income Tax," she said dreamily.
"I've often wondered how that was done. Do you
like it?"</p>

<p>"No, Francesca," I said, "I do not like it. To be quite
frank with you I detest it."</p>

<p>"But you're helping the War," she said. "That ought
to buck you up like anything. Every extra penny you pay
is a smack in the eye for the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>, so cheer up and make
a good big return."</p>

<p>"I will do," I said, "what is strictly fair between myself
and the Government. I can afford to be just to the
<span class="sc">Chancellor</span>, but, by Heaven, I cannot afford to be
generous. Generosity has no place in an Income Tax
return."</p>

<p>"Go ahead with it then," she said. "I don't know
what's stopping you."</p>

<p>"You," I said, "are stopping me&mdash;you and that part of
my income from which the tax is not deducted at the
source."</p>

<p>"That sounds quite poetical," she said. "It runs into
metre directly. Listen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>No man can well be rude or even coarse</p>
<p>Who has his tax deducted at the source.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But I wish you'd tell me what it means."</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said bitterly, "you are pleased to be a
rhymer. You are, in fact, rhyming while the exchequer is
burning; and then you add insult to injury by asking me
the meaning of an elementary financial phrase."</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>does</i> it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," I said, "that if your money is invested in
public companies or things of that nature, then when your
half-yearly dividend&mdash;You know what a dividend is?"</p>

<p>"Rather," she said. "It comes in on blue paper or pink,
and you say, 'That's something to be thankful for;' and
you write your name on one half of it and you send
that half to the bank, and you tear off the other half and
lose it in the next spring-cleaning. I know what a dividend
is all right."</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said, "your knowledge is very wonderful.
But if you suppose that that is the whole dividend, you are
much mistaken. It is the dividend minus the tax. The
company saves you trouble by deducting the tax and pays
it to the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> for you."</p>

<p>"Bravo the company!" said Francesca.</p>

<p>"And so say I. You see you never get that part of your
money, so there's no temptation to spend it&mdash;in fact you
don't spend it."</p>

<p>"That," she said, "sounds highly plausible."</p>

<p>"Yes, but listen. Suppose you've got some little job at,
say, two hundred and fifty pounds a year"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Like the little job you were so pleased to get a few
years ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "more or less like that."</p>

<p>"Not so honourable, of course," said Francesca.</p>

<p>"No, of course not, but similar as to emoluments. Well,
in that case you get the whole amount, and you spend it in
perfectly useless things and forget all about it after you've
put it down in your return; and then suddenly some
Surveyor of Taxes writes and demands Income Tax on
those two hundred and fifty pounds, actually demands
something like forty pounds. I tell you, it goes through
you like a knife."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any remedy?"</p>

<p>"Of course I could chuck the job," I said, "or do it for
nothing. Yes, I think I'll chuck it. It'll be a lesson
to them."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it would probably make the Government
sit up&mdash;but, on the whole, I don't think I should go
so far if I were you. You see"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on," I said, for she was hesitating. "Let us strip
ourselves of everything at once and throw ourselves on
the charity of our neighbours."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I'd go on for a bit. A job's a job
even if it does make you pay. You've had &pound;210 on balance,
and you ought to be thankful to have been allowed to pay
forty pounds for munitions."</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "perhaps you'll let me get on with
my work."</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>If it should ever be your lot, which pray Heaven forbid,
to be stranded on the coast of Panama, seek out Miss
<span class="sc">Winifred James</span> as your hostess, for she can teach you
how to tolerate, and even in a way enjoy, an existence one
might have thought unendurable. She lives, I gather,
some two hundred miles or so from the Canal, in a town
that is going to be built some fine day on a site that has
to be prepared by filling up a marsh with clay and sand.
In the meantime, until the day and the town arrive, she
rightly describes herself as <i>A Woman in the Wilderness</i>
(<span class="sc">Chapman and Hall</span>). Civilisation is turned back to front
out there, for although such comforts as refrigerators and
electric light are a matter of course, there is still lacking
to <i>Mrs. Henry de Jan</i> and her rather shadowy <i>William</i>
anything, for instance, in the nature of a road on which to
walk, or indeed any approach to their own verandah except,
floating on the clay, a narrow plank gangway that has to
serve as a hustling high-road for a mixed and dusky
populace. Under the circumstances she has done nobly
well to arm herself with the twin defences of cheerfulness
and humour; and if the cheerfulness comes at times near
to being that of a martyr on the rack, while the fun is
perilously apt to swing from themes that are nice for a
lady's wit to others that are not so nice, and back to sheer
triviality, what, in the name of a population of sand-flies
and negroes, can you expect? It is much that so lifelike
a picture of a region so desolate should be presented on
the whole with sweetness and charm, when no better
material is available than the myriad misdeeds of her
coloured servants, the antics of her puppies and an occasional
reminiscence of home.</p>

<hr />

<p>Certainly <span class="sc">Violet Hunt</span> and <span class="sc">Ford Madox Hueffer</span> have
one achievement to their credit. They have evolved an
entirely new and original setting in which to bring together
a number of short stories. What is supposed to happen is
that sundry persons who did not feel exactly drawn towards
bed before 2 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on those summer nights when Zeppelins
were about, meet for bridge and sandwiches and incidentally
to listen to certain stories read aloud by their author.
In this way they are able to forget their apprehensions of
the gas-bags (dare I put it that they lose Count?) and spend
a pleasant series of evenings with history. For the stories
in <i>Zeppelin Nights</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) are all historical of a kind.
Mostly they deal with the byways of history, or rather with
the emotions of ordinary people who are just on the outer
edge of historical happenings. For example, the central
figure of the first is a slave whose basket of figs is upset by
<span class="sc">Pheidippides</span> running from Marathon; while the last concerns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
an insignificant little anti-militarist who finds himself
cheering for the army on the outbreak of the Boer War.
That is the kind of tales they are, slight and momentary
things, with no plot but plenty of atmosphere, and in
their style remarkably well done. Whether they would
actually keep the nerve-ridden oblivious of bombs for the
thousand-and-one nights that might have seen raids and
didn't is a matter that need not concern us. For my part,
I liked as much as any the pages in which Miss <span class="sc">Hunt</span> or
Mr. <span class="sc">Hueffer</span> folded up her or his manuscript and allowed
the other (whichever it was) to tell us about the very
pleasant and human audience. I had only one disappointment,
but that was acute. I did want just once for them
to hear a distant bang, and see what happened. I rather
doubt whether the placid and literary charm of the tales
would have sufficed to keep them within doors had there
been anything to see outside.</p>

<hr />

<p>"In his hot indignation his yellowish face had in places
turned blackish: literally,
black streaks ran from the
corners of his lips upwards
and downwards, and from
the inner corners of his
eyes." If you read that
sentence in a novel with
Mr. <span class="sc">Edgar Jepson's</span> name
on the cover, and found
that the passage was a description
of a man named
<i>Shadrach Penny</i>, would you
not, as I did, settle down
comfortably in your armchair
and wait with perfect
confidence for the human
zebra to murder somebody
in the most fascinatingly
brutal manner? But he did
not do anything of the
kind. I think that the fact
that I was disappointed in,
and even seriously bored
by, <i>The Man Who Came
Back</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) was
largely due to the mild, dull
way in which the story developed. And yet I think I could
have forgiven the absence of lurid sensationalism if the
book had been a good book of its kind. It is not. It is so
crude and amateurish that it is difficult to believe that a
professional writer could have written it. Mr. <span class="sc">Jepson</span>, like
most other authors, has had the idea of modernising the
story of the Prodigal Son. He adheres to the original story
closely in one respect, for <i>Roland Penny's</i> first meal in his
old home consists of roast veal, but he departs from it in
making <i>Roland</i>, so far from wasting his substance, amass
a large fortune among the husks and swine. I do not
know how to classify <i>The Man Who Came Back</i>. It is not
a novel of incident, for nothing happens in it. It is not a
novel of character, for there is no attempt at any but the
crudest character-drawing. It is just a six-shilling novel,
and I do not see what else one can say of it. Mr. <span class="sc">Jepson</span>
must do one of two things. He must either brace up and
make his style less irritatingly slipshod, or he must give us
a few more murders. If we cannot have literary elegance
he must give us blood.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lieutenant <span class="sc">L. B. Rundall</span>, of the 1st Gurkha Rifles,
author of <i>The Ilex of Stra-Ping</i> (<span class="sc">Macmillan</span>), was not only
a soldier and a sportsman, but a writer with a most
keen sense of the beauty of nature and the beauty of
words. Children should love these Himalayan sketches,
for Mr. <span class="sc">Rundall</span>, from material which in some cases was
admittedly slight, could weave a tale full of magic and
charm. The story of the old brown bear in "The Scape-goat"
may not greatly stir the heart with the thrill of
adventure, but the hero has attractions that no child and
no man that has not forgotten his childhood could resist.
An inconspicuous notice in the book tells us that the
author fell in action towards the close of 1914. I salute
his memory. Rich as we are to-day in authors who can
write enchantingly of birds and animals, I feel a sense of
personal sorrow in the loss of one whose work gave so fair
a promise of high achievement.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you take up <i>Russian Folk-Tales</i> (<span class="sc">Kegan, Paul</span>),
don't allow yourself to be subdued by the deplorably learned
preface of the translator, Mr. <span class="sc">Leonard Magnus, LL.B.</span>,
because it is not the proper attitude really. Forget how
little business a Bachelor
of Law has to lay his
sceptical hands on such
inappropriate material, and
plunge into a jolly, bewildering
tangle of tales
of magic and adventure,
bloodthirstiness and treachery,
simple charity, <i>vodka</i>
and genial superstition.
You will be led from one
to the other, puzzled but,
I dare conjecture, highly
entertained. I think you
may take it, too, that a
certain healthy sort of
children will like to have
these queer stories read
aloud. The villainies of
the <i>B&aacute;ba Yag&aacute;</i>, an old
witch of terrific resourcefulness,
and the oddly inconsequent
animal stories
should make particular appeal.
But you will be hard
put to it to answer the
questions which will be thrust at you; and (by the way)
perhaps you will discreetly have to leave out a phrase or
two for prudence' sake. On no account let the youngsters
read the preface. I am not really quite sure whether you
ought to read it yourself.</p>
